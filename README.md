# 🔐 PINICN V2 – Token Locker Smart Contract dApp

**PINICN V2** is a decentralized application that allows users to **lock ERC-20 tokens** securely until a specified unlock time. This is useful for **vesting**, **delayed token releases**, or building trust in token-based ecosystems. The project includes both the **Solidity smart contract** and a **React + TypeScript frontend** for end-user interaction.
